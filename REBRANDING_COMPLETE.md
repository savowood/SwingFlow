## 🎓 YOUR UNIQUE STORY

**When People Ask About SwingFlow:**

*"SwingFlow emerged from my background teaching Lindy Hop. Just as I learned to synthesize Savoy's authentic foundations with Hollywood's refined polish (creating my 'savowood' teaching style), I've applied those same principles to trading.*

*In dance, success comes from reading rhythm, timing, and flowing with your partner's momentum. In trading, it's about reading market rhythm, perfect timing, and flowing with institutional momentum.*

*Whether you're swing dancing or swing trading, the principle is the same: understand the rhythm, move with the flow, and know when to lead versus follow."*

**The Triple Meaning:**
- For traders: "Oh, swing trading + market flow = SwingFlow"
- For dancers: "Nice! Swing dancing reference!"
- For you: Full depth of meaning connecting both worlds

### Extended Pitch (2 minutes):
